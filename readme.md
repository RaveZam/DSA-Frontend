Tasks

Remove the Use Context Part since it is inefficient in my code base and just fucks up the Predictive month (Predictive month is not loading if i cancelled out the loading in the Dashboard area indicating it is still reliant on Dashboard to Load first then go to Weekly Insights which is fuck that)

Finish All the Computations(average weekly sales)

Add a Conversion Rate in Dashboard
Add a Visitor Count in Dashboard

Maybe Replace the 2nd Bargraph in Dashboard to a PieGraph
